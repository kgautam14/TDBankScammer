# TDBankScammer
My friend received a text from whait we believed was a Scammer and it reminded me of Engineer Man's Scammer video from YouTube, and thought I should try this myself.

If you have ever recieved a message or an email, directing you to a phishing website i.e illegitimate and trying to scam you, this code can help you save others from this trap.
I'd recommend watching the video for a quick tutorial on how the code works.

Run scammer.py/random-name to run the program.
